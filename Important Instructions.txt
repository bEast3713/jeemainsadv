Hi guys, this is Mighty Dot, 
who is sharing this test series with you all.

How to use these tests ?
Just use a winrar or winzip extractor and in the main folder the extracted one run the html file named
index

then you will get a interface like JEE mains and can continue further.
Any issues then contact me here @IITjeematerials_bot on telegram

Good day, 
Mighty Dot.

Donot make any changes in the files or codes, the result of this would be you won't be able to attempt tests
properly, Only open index and enjoy tests.
